# TMS320C24 Processor Extension for Ghidra

Author: Paul G. Banks [(https://paulbanks.org)](https://paulbanks.org)

## Notes:

This implements the disassembler for the ISA described in the TMS320F/C24x DSP Controllers Reference Guide (spru160c.pdf), allowing you to load firmwares based on that ISA into Ghidra.

At this stage, all opcodes should be described but I have implemented limited opcode behaviours so the decompilation output will not be useful. 

At some point I may do more if time/demand permits; at the time of writing there's a good chance of some more updates.
